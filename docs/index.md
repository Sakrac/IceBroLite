Ice Bro Lite is a visual GUI debugger that connects to the VICE C64 emulator (version 3.5 and higher).

It works by connecting to the Binary Monitor in VICE, and for some features the Remote Text Monitor. This tool can be downloaded for [Windows](https://github.com/Sakrac/IceBroLite/releases) and compiled for [Linux](../linux.MD) and [Mac](../mac.MD).

The latest version of VICE can be downloaded from [here](https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/index.html#download).
